          <div class="box">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a senior server programmer.<br>
            <b>I have worked as a server side programmer for nine years.</b> I have plenty experiance in server side programming. I have made MMORPG server from beginning. It will be released soon.<br>
            <b>I can use C++ and C# mainly but I can use Python and Node.JS too.</b> I think whether can use languages doesn't matter but important thing is what modules do this job and what interface open to others. When I am programming, always I think that.<br>
            <b>I used to addicted patterns but I am not no more.</b> Patterns is important too but we want to avoid gold painting for patterns. These days, I usually use simple patterns like concreate, strategy, factory, template method and etc that are easy-reading and easy-using.<br>
            <b>I believe TDD is good thing until now.</b> But TDD is hard to use in work field. I made black box unit test module that check comming proper output packet when input packet. I am doing TDD by using it.<br>
            <b>Commucation is very important too.</b> I saw many projects were failed by miss communication. I have ideal thinking that every commucation must be opened to everyone. So, I made BleassChat that is for chatting program in bless project members. It helps to communicate with bless members and everyone can easily access communication. It has private chat function too.<br>
            <b>I have interest in open source projects and new technologies.</b> I am making a scalable chat server using Node.js and Redis for a personal work. My goal is to make a game server that can accept unlimited users and run continuously. There are three requirements for this. First, it should have a good scalability. Second, it should not have a single point of failure. Last, it should have a reliable fail over process. I am always studying and making personal works to achieve it.<br>
	    As gamer, I'm a old and core user. I have played games since when I was in elementary school. These days, I don't have enough time to play but I try to play new games as possible as many to know the trend of games. Games of my life are 'tactics ogre' and 'X-com'</p>
